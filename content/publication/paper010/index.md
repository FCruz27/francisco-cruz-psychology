abstract: Holistic processing aids in the discrimination of visually similar objects, but it may also come with a cost. Indeed holistic processing may improve the ability to detect changes to a face while impairing the ability to locate where the changes occur. We investigated the capacity to detect the occurrence of a change versus the capacity to detect the localization of a change for faces, houses, and words. Change detection was better than change localization for faces. Change localization outperformed change detection for houses. For words, there was no difference between detection and localization. We know from previous studies that words are processed holistically. However, being an object of visual expertise processed holistically, visual words are also a linguistic entity. Previously, the word composite effect was found for phonologically consistent words but not for phonologically inconsistent words. Being an object of visual expertise for which linguistic information is important, letter position information, is also crucial. Thus, the importance of localization of letters and features may augment the capacity to localize a change in words making the detection of a change and the detection of localization of a change equivalent.
