abstract: In four studies, we explored the relation between mind-body dualism and morality, specifically, whether people associate whether the basis for a behavior is material (e.g., brain) or immaterial (e.g., soul) with the behavior’s morality. We expected immaterial bases (more than material ones) to be associated with moral behaviors, as a) immaterial-based behaviors should be seen as more reflecting people’s true self, and b) the true self tends to be seen as fundamentally good. In Study 1, participants indicated that behaviors brought about by an agent’s soul were more likely to be moral than those prompted by their brain. In Study 2, behaviors presented as stemming from an agent’s soul (vs. brain) were rated higher in attributions of true self. In Study 3, behaviors described as reflecting the agent’s true self were considered more moral than those lacking in these properties. In Study 4, we replicated Study 1’s finding that people expect behaviors prompted by a soul to be moral, and we also observed self-other differences such that participants ascribed more soul-based and moral behaviors to themselves than to other people.
