abstract: In 2019, we published a paper in the Journal of Expertise (Ventura et al., 2019) showing that visual words show holistic processing, deemed a characteristic of faces, when the visual stimuli are within the limits of expertise of the Visual Word Form System (Cohen et al., 2008) and thus when there is fast parallel reading. In this commentary, we discuss this evidence considering the perspective of shared processing across both faces and words vs. the perspective of domain specificity for the processing of each domain. Considering the most recent evidence of mutual interference of holistic processing of words and faces (Ventura et al., 2023), we conclude for the first perspective; i.e., shared processing across both faces and words.
