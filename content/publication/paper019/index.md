abstract: People do not think that all psychological phenomena are equally explainable through science: Psychological phenomena associated with a high first-person subjective experience (henceforth, FPSE; i.e. associated with a strong phenomenological experience) are considered less scientifically explainable than low-FPSE psychological phenomena (i.e. those lacking such phenomenological quality). We contrast two possible accounts for this finding - 1) a generalized tendency to consider high-FPSE phenomena less explainable through science, and 2) a tendency to evoke a specific type of scientific explanation, more closely aligned with people’s beliefs about the nature of low-FPSE phenomena, that makes those phenomena be perceived as more explainable by science. Across two studies, participants considered different explanatory stances (as posited in the philosophy of mind literature - intentional, design/functional, and physical/implementational) and reported the extent to which these could explain low- and high-FPSE phenomena. In Study 1, participants considered low-FPSE phenomena more explainable, and rated implementational explanations as better than intentional ones (but these did not interact). In Study 2, intentional and implementational explanations were deemed more appropriate to address high- and low-FPSE phenomena, respectively. Taken together, these results may suggest that both accounts can accommodate the higher explainability beliefs of low-FPSE phenomena, and that the fit between the characteristics of the explanation and of the phenomenon is considered when people are looking for the best scientific explanation.
