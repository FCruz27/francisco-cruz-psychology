abstract: Previous research has shown that, like faces, words are processed either holistically or through the automatic representation of their parts combined. The automaticity assumed to underlie the holistic processing of words presupposes that individuals have a relatively low level of control over these processes. However, they may also be capable of learning from their environments whether processing words as a whole is the most efficient processing strategyâ€”which would require at least some control over the corresponding processes. In fact, previous research supports this latter account in the context of the holistic processing of faces. When provided a task in which participants should ignore half of a stimuli (the irrelevant part) and pay selective attention to the other half (the target part), the participants become better at ignoring the irrelevant part when it is commonly misleading (i.e., this suggests a response that is different from that of the relevant part in the context of the task). In the present work, we extend these considerations to holistic word processing. Our results support a learned attentional account in the context of holistic word processing. When an irrelevant word part is systematically helpful for the judgment of a target word half, participants engage more in holistic processing (vs. when the irrelevant word half is misleading). This reflects an incidental statistical learning process in which individuals identify the irrelevant word half as either providing helpful or misleading information about the target half.
